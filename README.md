## Introduciton
This research project applies new machine-learning methods to theoretical chemistry, focusing on the motion of atoms in molecules and during reactions. The aim is to understand atomic motion at a detailed level by applying quantum mechanics and solving the Schr√∂dinger equation using wavefunctions and basis functions. The project involves creating potential energy surfaces (PESs) through machine learning techniques to enable accurate calculations of observables. In particular, we shall focus on 
* Demonstrating that with a neural-network-based random sampling "high dimensional model representation" it is possible to obtain an accurate PES from a single set of points;
* Demonstrating that by interpolating neural network parameters it is possible to obtain an accurate PES by combining several small neural networks;
